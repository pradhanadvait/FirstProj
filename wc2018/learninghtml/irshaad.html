    <p>
      The Hindi poetry slam event of Waves. It will be done in collaboration with Abhivyakti. Once again, majority work in the summer as we are gonna have national elims. A bit of added responsibility as its the first time it goes national.<br>Calling for participants, venues, judges. You will get to know a lot of people in the Hindi poetry circuit.
